The GHz DAC board manufactured by the Martinis Group is a reliable and cost-effective device which allows the end user to generate high-resolution waveforms. The Martinis Group also provides an interface to the board via LabRAD, a server-client software package which allows object abstraction across many programming languages. This implementation of the communication protocol with the GHz DAC board is designed in C# for the Eriksson Group for an easy interface with the corresponding software abstraction package, BadgerLoop.
